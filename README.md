# PE103 Calculator and answer generator

We were alowed to use a calculator for our PE exam. Since my instructor didn't specify what calculator should we use, I built my own.
The functionality involves basic arithmetic, BMI, WHR, and THR calculation. Other additional features include generating answers when an keyword or a minute, related detail is searched.
This project proves to be helpful since I got a perfect score in my examination.

## Still Incomplete
This project still needs improvement. I built this the night of my exam. Instead of studying, I built this instead.

### First time using Electron
This is my first time using electron with react so the code are sloppily written. Anyways, I'll get back to this in the future to further improve this project.

#### No Database integration
I didn't use a database for this because of limited time. I'll add this also in the future.
